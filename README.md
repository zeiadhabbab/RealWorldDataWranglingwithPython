# Real World Data Wrangling with Python ( Udacity - Data Analyst - Project 2 )

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical data wrangling techniques using Python. It focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing real-world datasets to derive actionable insights. The examples are tailored to teach key steps in handling messy data and preparing it for analysis, making it ideal for learners and professionals in data science.

## 🧰 Features

- Cleaning datasets by handling missing or incorrect values.
- Transforming and merging datasets for effective analysis.
- Visualizing data with clear and impactful charts.
- Utilizing Python libraries like `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`.
- Real-world examples for hands-on learning.



## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeiadhabbab/RealWorldDataWranglingWithPython.git
   cd RealWorldDataWranglingWithPython
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
